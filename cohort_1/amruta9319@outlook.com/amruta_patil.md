# BENIFITS OF CLOUD COMPUTING :
## >  Cost Saving :
 Moving to cloud computing may reduce the cost of managing and maintaining your IT systems. 
 Rather than purchasing expensive systems and equipment for your business, you can reduce your costs by using the resources of your cloud computing service provider. 
 #### Example
 Consider, in my office I hired 5 high-end designers for designing.
 If I wish to provide 5 computers with the latest processor and latest model it consumes near about 5 lakhs for this purpose. 
 After buying these computers I don't have an idea about how much profit I gain through these computers. Instead of buying these expensive computers if I buy an i3 version or computers with less RAM,hard-disk, and processors. And I  buy 5 virtual machine  IP address for these 5 computers on rent for designing purpose.
 Hence I reduced the cost through these.
 
 ## > Security :
 In the ever-increasing era of data breaches, a top cloud computing security solution has security protocols in place to protect sensitive information and transactions. 
 This prevents a third party from eavesdropping or tampering with data being transmitted.
 
 ## > Flexibility :
 Cloud computing allows employees to be more flexible in their work practices.
 #### Example
 you have the ability to access data from home, on holiday, or via the commute to and from work (providing you have an internet connection).
 If you need access to your data while you are off-site, you can connect to your virtual office, quickly and easily.
 
 ## Mobility :
 Cloud computing allows mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices.
 Through the cloud, you can offer conveniently accessible information to sales staff who travel, freelance employees, or remote employees, for better work-life balance.
 
 ## Insight :
 Many cloud-based storage solutions offer integrated cloud analytics for a bird's-eye view of your data.
 With your information stored in the cloud, you can easily implement tracking mechanisms and build customized reports to analyze information organization wide.
 From those insights, you can increase efficiencies and build action plans to meet organizational goals.
 
 ## Increase collaboration :
  Cloud computing makes collaboration a simple process.
  Team members can view and share information easily and securely across a cloud-based platform.
  Some cloud-based services even provide collaborative social spaces to connect employees across your organization, therefore increasing interest and engagement.
  Collaboration may be possible without a cloud-computing solution, but it will never be as easy, nor as effective.
  
  ## Quality control :
   In a cloud-based system, all documents are stored in one place and in a single format.
   With everyone accessing the same information, you can maintain consistency in data, avoid human error, and have a clear record of any revisions or updates.
   Conversely, managing information in silos can lead to employees accidentally saving different versions of documents, which leads to confusion and diluted data.

  ## Disaster Recovery :
  Cloud-based services provide quick data recovery for all kinds of emergency scenarios, from natural disasters to power outages.
